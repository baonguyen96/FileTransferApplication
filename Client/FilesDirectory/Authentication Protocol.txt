To validate same client over multiple sessions:

Client:
    When the client is created, its creation time is its ID.
    Create random initial master key R
    Create encryption key E = R + 1
    Create signature S = R + 2
    In each session from 1 -> n, update:
        E = E + 2
        S = S + 2

    For authentication:
        Session 0:
            Request CA Certificate to verify if valid Server
            Encrypt R using Server's public key to get R'
            Encrypt ID using E to get ID'
            Send R' and ID'
        Session 1 -> n:
            Encrypt ID using new E to get ID'
            Send ID'


Server:
    Create encryption key E, signature key S (for client)
    In each session from 1 -> n, update:
            E = E + 2
            S = S + 2

    For authentication:
        Session 0:
            Send CA Certificate
            Receive R' and ID'
            Decrypt R' using its private key to get back R
            E = R + 1
            Decrypt ID' using E to get client's ID and store
        Session 1 -> n:
            Decrypt ID' using new E to get client's ID
            Compare with stored ID to authenticate
