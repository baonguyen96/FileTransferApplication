Program coded using Java in IntelliJ IDEA.

There are two ways to run the system: via IDE or via Command Line environment.
To run program via IDE (this was developed via IntelliJ IDEA from Jetbrains), first open Server and Client projects on separated windows. Then individually click “run” to run each code in parallel.
To run program in the command line environment, first navigate to where the Server folder and the Client folder located on your local machine. In each module, navigate to the src folder. Run command “javac Server.java” for Server and “javac Client.java” for Client to compile the code. Then run “java Server” to start the Server and “java Client” to run the Client. After this, run as program instructs. 
To run program as jar files, to be added later.
